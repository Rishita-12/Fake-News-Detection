# Fake News Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to detect fake news using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The model is trained on a dataset of news articles and classifies them as either **fake** or **real** based on textual content.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Text vectorization using TF-IDF or Word Embeddings
- Machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Deep Learning models
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Deployment using Flask or Streamlit

## Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled news articles collected from various sources. It includes features such as:
- **Title**: Headline of the article
- **Text**: Full content of the news article
- **Label**: 1 for fake news, 0 for real news

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-prediction.git
   cd fake-news-prediction
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook for training:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage
1. **Train the Model**: Run the `train_model.py` script to train the model on the dataset.
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
2. **Test the Model**: Evaluate the model performance using `evaluate.py`.
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```
3. **Deploy the Model**: Use Flask or Streamlit to deploy the model.
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Results
The trained model achieves an accuracy of **X%** on the test dataset. Performance metrics include:
- Accuracy: **X%**
- Precision: **X%**
- Recall: **X%**
- F1-score: **X%**

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras (for deep learning models)
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
- Flask / Streamlit (for deployment)

## Future Enhancements
- Improve model accuracy using advanced deep learning techniques
- Integrate real-time news scraping
- Deploy the model as a web service
